# mygym

Library for developing reinforcement learning methods based on OpenAI's gym. Provides simulation environments for common reinforcement learning applications.

## Environments

### Cartpole

Can be used for balance (pole starts facing up, has to be balanced) and swing-up (pole starts facing down, has to be swing-up) tasks.

### Pendulum

### Toy

Environment for testing of learning and function approximation algorithms.

## TODOs:
- [x] add robot arm simulations
- [ ] add function approximation methods
- [ ] remove check_* methods
- [ ] add agents
- [x] add cartpole simulation
- [x] add pendulum simulation
- [x] add toy simulation
